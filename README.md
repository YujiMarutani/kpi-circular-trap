## Abstract

Advanced economies face persistent productivity stagnation despite increasingly sophisticated performance indicators.
This project defines the root cause of this stagnation as the **KPI Circular Trap**: a self-referential loop in which low-resolution consensus metrics suppress high-resolution individual sovereignty.

We formalize individual sovereignty using the χ-model and propose a decentralized learning pipeline connecting open educational resources (OCW), AI-assisted sensemaking, and decentralized validation mechanisms.
This pipeline enables individuals to bypass institutional filtering and reconstruct knowledge at higher semantic resolution.

The central contribution of this work is not only the presentation of a theoretical framework, but the implementation of a verification apparatus, **CIFF (Continuous Integration for Fundamental Freedom)**, which evaluates whether knowledge artifacts are generated under human sovereignty rather than autonomous AI production.
CIFF operationalizes this distinction through asymmetry-based verification, examining semantic deviation, responsibility density in code, and iterative self-negation across versions.

This repository represents a **growth-oriented publication model**, where the DOI corresponds to a continuously evolving institutional artifact rather than a finalized conclusion.
Version 1.0 constitutes the canonical baseline of this system, explicitly positioning the project as a dynamic protocol aiming to satisfy the condition:

> **dχ / dt ≥ 0**

## Design Principles

- **Human Sovereignty First**  
  AI systems are treated strictly as tools. Authorship, responsibility, and risk remain human.

- **Verification over Authority**  
  CIFF is a locally executable protocol, not a centralized judge or reputation system.

- **Growth over Finality**  
  This repository is intentionally incomplete. Evolution, refutation, and restructuring are first-class behaviors.

## CIFF: What It Is (and Is Not)

**CIFF is:**
- A verification protocol for human–AI asymmetry
- A local, inspectable process
- A safeguard against silent automation of cognition

**CIFF is not:**
- A global certification authority
- A productivity KPI
- A surveillance or ranking mechanism
